Welcome! You have found your way to an in-progress hypertext notebook that describes some key findings from our [Sloan-funded research project](https://oasisresearchlab.github.io/synthesis-infrastructure-foundation/index.html) investigating novel tools and organizational structures that can support new infrastructures for research synthesis. The research here is led by [Joel Chan](http://joelchan.me/) and [Siyi Zhu](https://www.siyizhu.net/) out of the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://hcil.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, and builds on and extends earlier work done in collaboration with [Robert Haisfield](https://robhaisfield.com/about) and [Brendan Langen](https://www.brendanlangen.com/) on [Scaling Synthesis](https://scalingsynthesis.com/)

This notebook focuses on our findings about how researchers use novel **tools** (such as [hypertext notebooks](https://scalingsynthesis.com/q-what-is-a-hypertext-notebook/)) to support the sensemaking work that is needed for research synthesis. Through in-depth guided tours and interviews with 22 researchers across a range of disciplines, we've learned how complex, messy, and long-term sensemaking is hard because of [[Spatial Fragmentation of Information During Sensemaking|spatial]] and [[Temporal Fragmentation of Sensemaking|temporal]] fragmentation of information. To address these challenges, our participants have developed a range of "use patterns" in their tools to achieve core functions like [[üöõ Transfer Information Artifacts Between Different Locations|transferring information artifacts between different locations]], [[üèóÔ∏è Consolidate Materials for Active Sensemaking|gathering and consolidating spatially fragmented information for sensemaking]], and [[üé¢ Track Status of Sensemaking|tracking and managing the state of their sensemaking as it evolves over time]]
## How can you use these notes?
You can navigate through the notebook by following links (inline), as well as backlinks (at the bottom of the document: to see what other pages link to the current page), and using the graph view in the sidebar.

Since this is a hypertext notebook, there isn't really a strict linear path through these findings. But the overall structure of key content types and their relationships may give you some clues on fruitful ways to navigate:

Within this structure, one way you might structure your exploration is to begin by perusing the key **Problems** of sensemaking ([[Temporal Fragmentation of Sensemaking]] and [[Spatial Fragmentation of Information During Sensemaking]]), and then within that context, navigate to the core **Functions** that participants require of their tools and workflows in order to address these key problems (e.g., [[üèóÔ∏è Consolidate Materials for Active Sensemaking]], [[üé¢ Track Status of Sensemaking]]). These core function pages will then describe and link to clusters of **Use Patterns** (e.g., [[Incubator Notes]]) that fulfill these core functions.  The patterns in turn will link to and describe specific **Technical Primitives** and **Tools** that are used to enact the patterns (e.g., [[Backlink]] in [[Bear]]). This might be an especially fruitful path for scholars looking for ways to improve their sensemaking workflows, as well as researchers looking for hypotheses to test about how tools can improve sensemaking work.

Or you might begin with **Technical Primitive** or **Tool** pages and peruse their backlinks to understand what sorts of sensemaking workflows might be constructed from them. This might be an especially fruitful path for tool-builders.
## How do we know these patterns are actually useful / necessary for sensemaking?

These are just the patterns that our participants reported were useful for them. We're particularly confident, though, in these patterns, which are reported in more scholarly depth in a [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3654777.3676338) we published at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) in 2024:
- [[Explicit Note Types for Sensemaking Stages]]
- [[Hub Notes]], [[Index Notes]], and [[Incubator Notes]]

Ultimately, though, the strength of our data is in the description, rather than causal evidence of efficacy. We encourage you to test these patterns out yourself and share back the results!
## Can you fix errors or otherwise improve this notebook? 

Yes, issues or pull requests are welcome on our [github repository for this notebook](https://github.com/oasisresearchlab/tools-for-synthesis)! Here are some ideas for what we expect might need improvement over time:
* The list of tools is representative but not exhaustive, so you're welcome to suggest new tools to add, especially if they relate to any of the technical primitives and/or use patterns. 
* Many of the tools also evolve (sometimes with extensive plugin ecosystems), so various technical primitives or use patterns might be possible to enact in tools that we've missed. 
* We'd also be really keen to hear of any other patterns you've observed or come up with.
