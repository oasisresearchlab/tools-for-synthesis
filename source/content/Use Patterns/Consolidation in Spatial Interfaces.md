## Motivation and Description

Users gather information artifacts in spatial interfaces such as canvases to [[üèóÔ∏è Consolidate Materials for Active Sensemaking|assemble materials for active sensemaking]]. Spatial layouts make it easier to see relationships among artifacts because they allow [[‚úàÔ∏è Freely Navigate and Manipulate Information Artifacts|free navigation and manipulation]].
## Example(s)

One [[Obsidian]] user frequently placed notes onto a [[Canvas]] to freely manipulate them while making sense of previously captured content. He even upgraded his computer to improve canvas performance, enabling him to keep more notes open at once.

Another user moved information artifacts from Roam Research into a [[Mind Map]] using [[Freeplane]]. In this environment, he could quickly expand or collapse branches and reposition artifacts with keyboard shortcuts, supporting efficient navigation and structural reorganization.
