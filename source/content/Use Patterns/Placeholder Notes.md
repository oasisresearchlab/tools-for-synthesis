## Motivation and Description

Users often create notes with no internal content except a descriptive title. We observed that this served two main functions:
1. [[ðŸŽ¢ Track Status of Sensemaking|Tracking sensemaking status]] â€” the degree of emptiness reflects how much work has been done on the underlying concept.
2. Supporting [[ðŸŽ£ Retrieve Information Artifacts|Supporting retrieval]] â€” when most of the value lies in their [[Backlink]]s, these notes act as navigational [[Hub Notes|hubs]] to related artifacts.
## Example(s)

### Creating an empty note as a placeholder
A [[Zettlr]] user kept an empty concept [[Note Page]] containing only [[Metadata|YAML metadata]]. Knowing the topic would be important later, he created the page in advance to serve as a placeholder for future notes or links.

In his words:

> _It's empty, because I just thought, "oh, this might be important for later."_

### Leaving a simple note as a pointer
A [[Bear]] user created a page with a descriptive title but very little content other than [[Backlink]]s to other notes. This rough/minimal note functioned as a pointer to ideas to be revisited and expanded later. This pointer characteristic also illustrated how hubs can evolve into incubators, preserving continuity across interrupted sensemaking sessions.

### Crafting an empty note to represent non-digital materials
A [[Roam Research]] user maintained empty experiment [[Note Page]]s in a shared graph because the experiment records existed in a [[Physical Notebook]]. These pagesâ€™ [[Backlink]]s connected them to meeting notes and the userâ€™s personal homepage, turning them into navigational hubs for quick navigation and centralizing of distributed information.

## What's needed to enact this pattern

In addition to the tools mentioned above, this pattern can be supported by any tool that includes the following technical primitive(s):
- [[Internal Hypertext Links]]
- [[Backlink]]s
