## Motivation and Description

To address [[Temporal Fragmentation of Sensemaking|the temporally fragmented nature of complex sensemaking]], users often create intermediate products that store early-stage sensemaking results.  

Summary notes are one such intermediate product in the sensemaking process. In scholarly work, processing source materials such as papers or experimental results is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Summary notes capture a userâ€™s interpretation of these materials before they are synthesized into new bodies of knowledge.

These notes are often closely tied to [[Source Note]]sâ€”sometimes even contained within themâ€”making it easier to [[ðŸŒ± Track Provenance of Information Artifacts|trace the provenance of the ideas]].

Because summary notes are transitional, they may be [[Explicit Archiving|archived or retired]] once they have been used to produce [[Synthesis Note]]s. This movement of meaning from summary notes to synthesis notesâ€”and the eventual retirement of the summariesâ€”illustrates the lifecycle of many artifacts in hypertext-based notetaking systems. This lifecycle also allows summary notes to serve as a way to [[ðŸŽ¢ Track Status of Sensemaking|track sensemaking progress over time]].

## Example(s)

### Summary notes within a source note

One user included a [[Summary Note]] inside a [[Source Note]] in [[Roam Research]].
- The [[Note Page]] was titled with the citekey of a paper.
- The page linked to the original [[PDF File]] in [[Zotero]] via [[Zotero Roam]].
- Beneath the metadata, a [[Note Block]] was [[Tag|tagged]] with `#litnotes` to summarize the userâ€™s understanding of the paper.

### Creating a structured summary note
Another user wrote a summary note as a [[Note Block]] inside a source note in [[Roam Research]].
- The summary captured evidence from the literature represented by the source note.
- Both the source note and the summary note followed their own internal structures.
