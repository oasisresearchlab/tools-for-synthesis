## Motivation and Description

In collaborative environments, hypermedia systems often handle rapidly changing information artifacts. By guiding collaborators with different information needs, these systems can improve the user experience of [[üé£ Retrieve Information Artifacts|retrieval]] and [[ü§ù Collaborate on Sensemaking|make collaborative sensemaking more efficient while reducing uncertainty]].
## Example(s)

One participant created a dashboard in [[Roam Research]], which supports [[Real-time collaboration|real-time multi-user editing]]. The dashboard, built using [[Note Page]] and [[Internal Hypertext Links]]s, directed collaborators to role-specific pages. Each linked page contained [[Structured Queries]] tailored to the needs and purposes of that role, enabling targeted access to relevant information artifacts.

## What's needed to enact this pattern

In addition to the tools mentioned above, this pattern can be supported by any tool that includes the following technical primitive(s):

- [[Internal Hypertext Links]]
- [[Structured Queries]]
- [[Real-time collaboration]]
