## Motivation and Description

Users create incubators to [[üé¢ Track Status of Sensemaking|track the progress of sensemaking]] while also [[üèóÔ∏è Consolidate Materials for Active Sensemaking|gathering artifacts for synthesis]] over time. Like [hubs](obsidian://open?vault=sloan-tool-review&file=v0.2%2FUse%20Patterns%2FProcessing%2FHubs) and [indices](obsidian://open?vault=sloan-tool-review&file=v0.2%2FUse%20Patterns%2FProcessing%2FIndices), incubators centralize artifacts, making them easy to [[üé£ Retrieve Information Artifacts|retrieve]] and [[‚ôªÔ∏è Reuse Information Artifacts|reuse]]. [[Hub Notes]] and [[Index Notes]] can grow into [[Incubator Notes]] when additional content enables them to track the evolving sensemaking process.
## Example(s)
### Traversing across artifacts using incubators
One [[Bear]] user maintained a log-style note to track progress on a research project. The log included [[Internal Hypertext Links]] to other [[Note Page]]s, enabling quick navigation across related content. [[Daily Chronological Notes|Daily notes]] embedded within the incubator were essential for reconstructing the history of the user‚Äôs sensemaking process.

### Incubating experiment observations 
A [[Roam Research]] user documented observations from an experiment in a [[Note Page]], organized chronologically. Each date linked to its own daily note page in [[Internal Hypertext Links|wikilink]] format, with the relevant content stored as child [[Note Block]]s. This structure allowed the user to track experimental progress over time and provided source material for synthesizing results and conclusions.
