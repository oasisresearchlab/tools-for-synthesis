## Motivation and Description

Because [[Spatial Fragmentation of Information During Sensemaking|reading and note-taking often occur in separate locations]] in hypertext-based workflows, users need ways to track reading progress as part of [[🎢 Track Status of Sensemaking|monitoring the status or progress of their sensemaking]].
## Example(s)

### Tracking reading progress using labels
One [[DevonThink]] user applied [[Tag|labels]] to [[PDF File]]s to indicate their current status. “To Read” marked items planned for future reading, while “To Process” indicated materials that had been read but not yet converted into notes.

### Tracking reading progress using lists  
A [[Tana]] user organized reading progress through [[Tab]]s in a [[Structured Queries|structured query]] of papers, each represented as a [[Source Note]]. Papers were assigned a status --- such as "Unread" --- in their [[Metadata|Status field]]. All papers with that status appeared automatically in the “Unread” query of the Papers, separating them from completed readings.

## What's needed to enact this pattern

In addition to the tools mentioned above, this pattern can be supported by any tool that includes the following technical primitive(s):
- [[Tag]]
- [[Structured Queries]]
- [[Metadata]]
