## Motivation and Description

Organizing information artifacts at the moment of [[🏗️ Consolidate Materials for Active Sensemaking|capture]] requires substantial effort. To reduce cognitive load, many users create an intermediate space for storing artifacts [[🚛 Transfer Information Artifacts Between Different Locations|as they are downloaded or moved between applications]]. This intermediate space also [[🎢 Track Status of Sensemaking|marks the inception of sensemaking]] in a digital note-taking system.
## Example(s)

One participant used a special [[Folder]] in Finder called “SendToDevon” to collect newly downloaded PDFs for later import into [[DevonThink]] for categorization and sensemaking. Files that would not be directly used in their sensemaking—such as CVs, grant forms, and curricula—were stored outside this folder.

Another participant maintained an ordered [[File Management System|folder system]] in [[Obsidian]], where folder numbers reflected the processing stage of materials: lower numbers indicated raw, unprocessed content. The folder “02 Pending” served as a common space for newly captured artifacts; after sorting, items were moved into higher-numbered folders.
