## Motivation and Description

People‚Äôs understanding of information changes over time. Preserving and [[üé¢ Track Status of Sensemaking|tracking this evolving understanding]] is a key challenge when using note-taking tools to scaffold sensemaking. Hypertext users address this challenge by creating different forms of information artifacts in an evolving sequence.

Typically, users begin with a [[Source Note]] that contains raw information‚Äîfor example, paper notes or verbatim quotes from academic articles. From there, they produce [[Summary Note]]s (e.g., literature notes or evidence notes) that condense and interpret the source material. Finally, these may be developed into [[Synthesis Note]]s (e.g., permanent notes or concept notes) that directly support academic writing. This staged progression helps reduce cognitive load by gradually condensing large amounts of information into reusable [[Declarative Atomic Notes|declarative statements]], making it easier to track changes in understanding over time.

## Example(s)

### Evidence Notes and Hypothesis Notes

One [[Roam Research]] user kept both evidence notes‚Äîcontaining findings and results from prior studies‚Äîand hypothesis notes‚Äîcapturing the user‚Äôs assumptions. The user maintained explicit [[Internal Hypertext Links|links]] indicating which evidence supported which hypotheses.

### Moving Quotes between Literature Notes and Concept Notes

Another [[Zettlr]] user moved quotes from literature notes into concept notes while reading a large book. Literature notes contained observations directly tied to a single source, whereas concept notes synthesized material from multiple related sources. This process allowed the user to retain only the most important ideas in concept notes while retiring the literature notes‚Äîeffectively ‚Äúdissolving‚Äù original sources into conceptual knowledge.

### Source materials and literature notes
One [[DevonThink]] user applied [[Tag|labels]] to PDFs to track processing status. A ‚ÄúTo Process‚Äù tag indicated the paper had been read and highlighted but not yet converted into notes; a ‚ÄúDone ‚Äì Processed‚Äù tag indicated the creation of a literature note in [[Obsidian]].
