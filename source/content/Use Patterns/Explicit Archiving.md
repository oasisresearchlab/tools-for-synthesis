## Motivation and Description

In hypertext-based note-taking tools, information artifacts typically have a life cycle. Existing artifacts are often used to create new ones, after which they are “downgraded” in prominence as the synthesis process shifts toward newer material. Because creating new artifacts involves transferring and integrating information, archiving older artifacts can help limit the number of active items to manage or [[🎣 Retrieve Information Artifacts|retrieve]], reducing cognitive load during synthesis. As a result, [[🏗️ Consolidate Materials for Active Sensemaking|artifacts that remain unarchived in the system are those most relevant to active sensemaking]].

This use pattern also supports the enactment of [[Index Notes]] and [[Incubator Notes]] by offering more control on what is shown/retrieved.

## Example(s)

### Metadata-based archiving

One user used [[Tana]] to convert literature notes into permanent notes. Literature notes took the form of [[Note Page|note pages]] about specific works, while permanent notes were source-agnostic and written in language ready for direct reuse in academic writing. After integrating a literature note into a permanent note, the participant marked it as “archived.” in the [[Metadata|metadata]] field for the note. Archived literature notes were excluded from the user's central [[Index Notes|index]] used for writing, which displayed only unprocessed literature notes and permanent notes.

### Folder-based archiving

Another example of natural note retirement came from a participant who described leaving some notes in a folder unused for years. Over time, he synthesized the most relevant notes into concept notes, while the remaining literature notes were naturally archived as the “sediment of time.”

## What's needed to enact this pattern

In addition to the tools mentioned above, this pattern can be supported by any tool that includes the following technical primitive(s):
- [[Metadata]]
- [[Folder]]
