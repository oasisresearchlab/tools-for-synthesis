## Motivation and Description

Users filter information artifacts to [[üèóÔ∏è Consolidate Materials for Active Sensemaking|focus on the most useful and relevant materials for synthesis]] while [[üé£ Retrieve Information Artifacts|excluding less relevant artifacts]]. Filtering serves both as a retrieval strategy and as a means of reducing cognitive load during active sensemaking.
## Example(s)

### Queries
One [[Roam Research]] user identified relevant artifacts through [[Structured Queries]] embedded in a [[Note Page]]. He refined results by clicking the [[Filter]] icon atop each column or by directly editing the query structure, such as adjusting the time range.

### Filters in spatial interfaces

#### Filtering by metadata
In [[Cosma]], one user applied [[Filter]]s in the sidebar to include or exclude artifacts based on [[Metadata]] such as [[Explicit Note Types for Sensemaking Stages|note type]].

#### Filtering by distance between notes
In [[Cosma]]‚Äôs [[Graph view]], one user manipulated [[Depth of Focus Controls]] to display only nodes within a certain number of steps from the focal note. Similarly, an [[Obsidian]] user used a sidebar slider to adjust the depth of focus in the [[Graph view]], hiding artifacts not tightly connected to the current focus.

## What's needed to enact this pattern

In addition to the tools mentioned above, this pattern can be supported by any tool that includes the following technical primitive(s):

- [[Graph view]]
- [[Depth of Focus Controls]]
- [[Filter]]
- [[Structured Queries]]
