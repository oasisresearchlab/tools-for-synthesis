## Motivation and Description

Users create declarative, atomic statement notes to ensure they have modularized artifacts that are easy to [[üé£ Retrieve Information Artifacts|retrieve]] and [[‚ôªÔ∏è Reuse Information Artifacts|reuse]]. Because these atomic notes are simple and flexible, they can be integrated into more complex semantic structures. In practice, they often form the building blocks of [[Summary Note]]s and [[Synthesis Note]]s within hypertext-based sensemaking workflows.
## Example(s)

One participant in [[Roam Research]] began by taking informal, messy notes in daily pages. He later converted selected notes into [[Note Page]]s with formal declarative statements as their titles, creating reusable, modular content for downstream synthesis.

## What's needed to enact this pattern

Not much! Just the ability to set the title of a note.
