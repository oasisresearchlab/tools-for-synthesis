## Motivation and Description

Sensemaking of scholarly materials often involves complex source artifacts that do not fit neatly into a single category. For example, an academic paper may belong to multiple thematic groupings, but duplicating the file to place it in different folders can break its provenance and fragment updates. To address this, users need the ability to [[ðŸŽ£ Retrieve Information Artifacts|access a single artifact]] from multiple locations.
## Example(s)
