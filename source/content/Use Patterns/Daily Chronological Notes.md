## Motivation and Description

Users take notes in chronological order to [[üé¢ Track Status of Sensemaking|track the status of sensemaking]]. Because sensemaking processes are often temporally fragmented by disruptions and multitasking, maintaining a chronological sequence helps users reconstruct the timeline of information artifacts and sensemaking.
## Example(s)

One [[Roam Research]] user tracked the history of experiments by placing plans and records under [[Note Block]]s titled with specific dates.

Another [[Tana]] user treated daily notes as a [[Commonplace Inboxes|commonplace inbox]] for capturing new material. She created various types of notes within a [[Note Page]] tagged with the ‚Äú#day‚Äù [[Supertag]].
