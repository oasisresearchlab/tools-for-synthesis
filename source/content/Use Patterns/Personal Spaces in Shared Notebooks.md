## Motivation and Description

Shared hypertext-based notebooks are often used for [[ü§ù Collaborate on Sensemaking|collaborative sensemaking]] in labs and institutes. It is important for these shared spaces to [[üß± Establish Boundaries for Collaboration|clearly separate personal and public areas]]. This separation provides individual researchers with a private space for developing early stage ideas and for managing their own task progress before sharing with others.
## Example(s)

**Separate personal homepage**  
One [[Roam Research]] user maintained a dedicated [[Note Page]] as her personal homepage within a shared notebook. She used this page to track work progress through [[Daily Chronological Notes]] and to manage [[Task Items]], marking off completed work.
