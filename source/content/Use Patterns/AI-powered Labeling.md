## Motivation and Description

Maintaining consistency across information artifacts—particularly in labeling—is tedious and error-prone when done manually. Consistent labeling is critical for effective [[🎣 Retrieve Information Artifacts|retrieval]] and [[♻️ Reuse Information Artifacts|reuse]], yet difficult to sustain in personal information management systems. Leveraging [[Artificial Intelligence]] to generate consistent labels from an established database can significantly reduce cognitive load.

## Example(s)

One participant used [[Artificial Intelligence]] in [[Tana]] to construct an index listing all topic tags applied to literature and permanent notes. Within this topical index, AI was employed to reduce the burden of creating topical tags to apply to the [[Metadata]] for those notes. The participant implemented a “Set Topics” button next to each [[Note Block]] marked as a literature or permanent note; clicking it triggered an AI process that generated topical tags for the “Topics” field based on the note’s text.
