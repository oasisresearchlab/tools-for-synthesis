## Motivation and Description

Sharing of information artifacts is pervasive in [[ü§ù Collaborate on Sensemaking|collaborative sensemaking]]. Many users [[üß± Establish Boundaries for Collaboration|separate artifacts into distinct spaces]] so they can control what is shared and what actions collaborators can take.
## Example(s)

### Selective sharing based on collaborator roles

One user differentiated between loosely and closely involved collaborators. For those not tightly working with him, he sent [[PDF File]]s, collected feedback, and integrated revisions himself. For close collaborators, he granted direct [[Access Permission]] to the source file, enabling synchronous collaboration. He used [[Github]] for [[Versioning|version control]].

### Exporting partial content for controlled sharing

Another user maintained personal research notes in [[Logseq]] but selectively shared portions by moving them into [[Google Docs]]s. This allowed her to share only specific parts of her work without exposing the full [[Logseq]] notebook.
## What's needed to enact this pattern

In addition to the tools mentioned above, this pattern can be supported by any tool that includes the following technical primitive(s):
- [[Access Permission]]
- [[Versioning]]
