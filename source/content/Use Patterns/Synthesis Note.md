## Motivation and Description

In sensemaking work, users receive and cognitively internalize information from external sources.  They often use their own words to articulate the connections between these external sources and their own prior knowledge.

Hypertext-based notetaking systems make it possible to [[üé¢ Track Status of Sensemaking|mark this maturation of their thinking]]. Many users create synthesis notes to capture their understanding of the linkages between multiple summary notes, which supports both [[üèóÔ∏è Consolidate Materials for Active Sensemaking|consolidation]] and [[üå± Track Provenance of Information Artifacts|tracing of the provenance]] of ideas.

## Example(s)

### Integrating concept notes into a single claim

A user in [[Zettlr]] combined multiple concept notes into one synthesized claim. First, he created a new [[Note Page]] named after the claim. Then, he [[Internal Hypertext Links|added internal links to]] the relevant concept notes. Finally, he produced a paragraph blending plain text with hyperlinked references to other notes.

### Synthesizing multiple readings into a single concept note

A user in [[Bear]] merged insights from multiple readings into a single "concept-oriented" [[Note Page]] with a [[Declarative Atomic Notes|declarative title]]. This note incorporated multiple [[Internal Hypertext Links]] to other related notes, as well as the references for the main idea of the note.

### Creating permanent notes from literature notes

A user in [[Tana]] transformed literature notes into synthesis notes that he called "permanent notes", ready for use in downstream synthesis and writing. The note included [[Structured Queries]] in the [[Metadata|"Origin" field]] to the relevant literature notes that were the raw material for this synthesis note.

## What's needed to enact this pattern

In addition to the tools mentioned above, this pattern can be supported by any tool that includes the following technical primitive(s):
- [[Internal Hypertext Links]]
- [[Structured Queries]]
- [[Metadata]]
