## Motivation and Description

Links and [[Backlink|backlinks]] connect information artifacts into navigable networks, enabling users to [[ðŸŽ£ Retrieve Information Artifacts|retrieve materials]] by traversing these connections. In practice, users click through links and backlinks to move across related notes and artifacts.
## Example(s)

### Hubs: empty notes as waypoints
One [[Emacs with Org-mode]] user created an empty [[Note Page]] containing only metadata. The pageâ€™s [[Backlink]]s provided the primary navigational function, linking to related notes.

In another case, a [[Roam Research]] user maintained an empty literature note page containing only a structural outline. The pageâ€™s [[Backlink]]s connected it to other [[Note Page]]s, allowing quick traversal to related material.

### Centering artifacts around incubators
A [[Bear]] user kept a log-style note to track research project progress. This note embedded [[Internal Hypertext Links]] to other [[Note Page]]s, allowing smooth navigation across related artifacts.

## What's needed to enact this pattern

In addition to the tools mentioned above, this pattern can be supported by any tool that includes the following technical primitive(s):

- [[Backlink]]
- [[Internal Hypertext Links]]
