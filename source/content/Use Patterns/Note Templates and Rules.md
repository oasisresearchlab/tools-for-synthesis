## Motivation and Description

Templates and rules for the structure and contents of notes are used to create standardized information artifacts. Standardization supports [[üé£ Retrieve Information Artifacts|retrieval]], [[‚ôªÔ∏è Reuse Information Artifacts|reuse]], and [[ü§ù Collaborate on Sensemaking|collaborative work]] with information by establishing a common structure for understanding complex information.
## Example(s)

**Using templates for source notes**  
One [[Roam Research]] user applied [[Template]]s to structure [[Source Note|notes for source materials]] in a shared notebook. Templates included standardized [[Metadata]] fields and an outline for content. This ensured each [[Note Page]] followed the same format, making it easier to share with collaborators and reuse later. The group also created [[Summary Note|evidence notes]] from papers using past tense to reflect findings from completed studies.

### Using templates for literature notes
Another [[Roam Research]] user used a template to structure [[Summary Note|literature notes]] within a [[Source Note|source note page]]. The template included a predefined outline of desired details about scholarly work, along with comments clarifying each field. Metadata for the source material was also standardized and structured.

## What's needed to enact this pattern

In addition to the tools mentioned above, this pattern can be supported by any tool that includes the following technical primitive(s):
- [[Template]]
- [[Metadata]]
