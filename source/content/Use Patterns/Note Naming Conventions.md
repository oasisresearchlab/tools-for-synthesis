## Motivation and Description

Names are the shortest representation of an information artifact in a computational system. In hypertext-based note-taking tools, names of [[Note Page|note pages]] are a primary means of indexing and retrieving stored artifacts. Users often follow consistent naming conventions across their systems to make it easier to [[🎣 Retrieve Information Artifacts|retrieve artifacts]]. Some conventions also [[🎢 Track Status of Sensemaking|mark the stage of an artifact]] in the sensemaking process.
## Example(s)

One [[Roam Research]] user used [[Internal Hypertext Links|hypertext link names]] with standardized prefixes: “CLM –” for claim notes, “EVD –” for evidence notes, “QUE –” for question notes, “HYP –” for hypothesis notes, “ISS –” for issue notes, “RES –” for results notes, and “CON –” for conclusion notes. This enabled quick and focused inline retrieval of relevant notes by type via the [[Search Bar]] or [[Inline autocompletion]], by first typing the prefix, then relevant keywords.

The same user, and others, used “@” as a prefix for source-related notes. When referring to a piece of literature, the “@” preceded a [[Citekey]], such as “@roffay2021passive,” to name a literature note. This also allowed some [[Database Connectors to Reference Managers|coordination]] with their Zotero library. This user also applied “@” to experiment notes, e.g., “@TC/Geltrex vs matrigel.”

By combining conventions, the user could create compound names. For instance, evidence notes often derive from literature, so a name could include both the evidence statement and the source: `[[EVD]] – Hyposmotic shock increased plasma membrane tension within 10 seconds [[@roffay2021passive]]`

## What's needed to enact this pattern

Not much! Just the ability to set the title of a note.
