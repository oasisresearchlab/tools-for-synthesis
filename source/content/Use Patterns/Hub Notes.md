## Motivation and Description

Users create hubs to support a [[Link-Based Traversal|link-based navigational approach]] for [[üé£ Retrieve Information Artifacts|retrieving]] information artifacts. In some cases, hubs are intentionally left empty because the creator already holds the relevant knowledge mentally. These [[Placeholder Notes|empty notes]] function as navigational waypoints, relying on [[Backlink]]s to connect related artifacts.

In other cases, empty notes are left as placeholders for future content, with their emptiness indicating a lower level of maturity in the sensemaking process. Over time, as content is added, these notes may evolve from hubs into [[Incubator Notes]], gaining the ability to track the progression of understanding in addition to supporting navigation.
## Example(s)
### Empty notes as hubs
One [[Emacs with Org-mode]] user maintained an empty [[Note Page]] containing only metadata. [[Backlink]]s provided the primary navigational function, enabling quick traversal to related notes.

Another [[Roam Research]] user kept an empty [[Note Page]] as a placeholder for an experiment documented in a physical notebook. Backlinks connected this page to meeting notes and the user‚Äôs [personal homepage](obsidian://open?vault=sloan-tool-review&file=v0.2%2FUse%20Patterns%2FProcessing%2FSeparating%20Personal%20Notetaking%20from%20Collective%20Notetaking) within a shared notebook, allowing quick access to all references to the experiment.

### From hubs to incubators
A [[Bear]] user left a minimal [[Note Page]] containing a [[Backlink]] as a ‚Äúpointer‚Äù for future work. Over time, new content accumulated, with newer notes appearing lower in the document. This growth transformed the hub into a simple [[Incubator Notes|incubator]], enabling the user to track changes in sensemaking over time while still functioning as a navigational anchor.
