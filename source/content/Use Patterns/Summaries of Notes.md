## Motivation and Description

Notes often contain large amounts of detail and process records, much of which may be unstructured and lacking context. This can make them difficult to interpret‚Äîeven for their original authors. To make notes easier to [[‚ôªÔ∏è Reuse Information Artifacts|reuse for themselves]] and to [[ü§ù Collaborate on Sensemaking|share artifacts]] with others, users often create summaries of notes.
## Example(s)

### Using artificial intelligence to generate summaries
Some users employ [[Artificial Intelligence]] to produce summaries from existing note content. One [[Roam Research]] user used a plugin to create [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]]-generated summaries of his thoughts, making it [[ü§ù Collaborate on Sensemaking|easier for collaborators to understand the key points]]. These summaries were also useful for their own review and sensemaking at later time points.

### Manually creating summaries
Manual summarization is more common. One [[Zettlr]] user created literature notes, but when some grew too long to quickly extract key points, he added a summary section at the top.

Another [[Roam Research]] user ended her workflow for preparing a journal club discussion by writing a summary of literature notes. These summaries were later revisited for further synthesis.
