## Motivation and Description

Users often keep newly created or captured information artifacts in a [[Commonplace Inboxes|common place inbox]]. At first, these artifacts are messy and unorganized. Over time, they are moved into smaller, more meaningful categories.  One way to accomplish this is by [[üèóÔ∏è Consolidate Materials for Active Sensemaking|gathering relevant artifacts in a canvas]] and [[‚úàÔ∏è Freely Navigate and Manipulate information artifacts|moving, grouping, and comparing artifacts visually]].

## Example(s)

### Grouping artifacts on a canvas

One hypertext user dropped [[Note Page]]s into a [[Canvas]] in [[Obsidian]] and grouped them into columns.
- The left column contained writing-related note pages.
- The right column held concept notes he would reference in his writing.  He also used [[Drawing|drawn connections]] to visually link related [[Note Page]]s.
- Each of the note blocks on the canvas are not simple free-text notes, but [[Internal Hypertext Links]] to the relevant note pages, supporting downstream synthesis from this early stage visual sensemaking.

Another user analyzed findings and claims from a paper using [[Canvas]] in [[Roam Research]].
- He used [[Note Type Visual Controls|colors]] and spatial proximity to group related [[Note Block]]s.
- Lines were drawn between notes to indicate the types of relationships.
- As before, each of the colored note blocks on the canvas are [[Internal Hypertext Links]] to the relevant note pages, supporting downstream synthesis from this early stage visual sensemaking.

### Nesting canvases
One user created nested [[Canvas]] elements in [[Obsidian]] to show clusters of artifacts.
- Two canvases were embedded within a larger one.
- [[Drawing|Drawn connections]] illustrated the relationships between [[Note Page]]s and the embedded canvases.
## What's needed to enact this pattern

In addition to the tools mentioned above, this pattern can be supported by any tool that includes the following technical primitive(s):
- [[Canvas]]
- [[Drawing]]
- [[Note Type Visual Controls]]
