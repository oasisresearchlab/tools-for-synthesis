## Motivation and Description

Sensemaking is an information-intensive task. A single artifact‚Äîor a single view‚Äîoften provides too narrow a perspective for tackling complex problems. Viewing artifacts in multiple windows allows users to [[üèóÔ∏è Consolidate Materials for Active Sensemaking|display all relevant materials simultaneously]] and maintain cross-references during sensemaking.
## Example(s)

One [[Roam Research]] user worked on understanding a biological process using a [[Canvas]]. While sketching relationships on the canvas, he kept an evidence note open in the tool's sidebar. Evidence notes contained [[Note Block|notes]] about experimental findings from the literature, allowing him to cross-reference details without leaving the canvas view.

An [[Obsidian]] user maintained a primary note-taking window while keeping an [[Canvas]] open in the background. This setup let him reference the relationships between notes on the canvas while writing. He also kept a task table open in a separate window to monitor progress.
