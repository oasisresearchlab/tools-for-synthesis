## Motivation and Description

Hypertext-based note-taking tools are often separate from source material management systems such as Zotero, DevonThink, or PaperPile. As a result, users frequently include clearly marked excerpts (such as verbatim quotes with page numbers) in their notes to [[ðŸŒ± Track Provenance of Information Artifacts|(re)trace the provenance of the information in those notes]].

## Example(s)

One participant used both [[Storing and Displaying Image|screenshots]] and [[Block Quote|verbatim quotes]] in [[Note Block]]s within [[Roam Research]] while taking notes on a paper. These contextual materials were placed at a lower level of the indented structure, allowing them to be collapsed when not needed.

Another participant kept key highlighted text from a paper in [[Note Block]]s on the paperâ€™s [[Note Page]] in [[Tana]], tagging each with a [[Tag|supertag]] to mark it as a quote. These quotes served as source material for creating literature notes and permanent notes, and provided a way to track the provenance of those notes when needed.

## What's needed to enact this pattern

In addition to the tools mentioned above, this pattern can be supported by any tool that includes the following technical primitive(s):

- [[Storing and Displaying Image]]
- [[Block Quote]]
- [[Tag]]
