## Motivation and Description

Users often maintain source materials in a separate management system and link these databases to their digital note-taking tools to [[üå± Track Provenance of Information Artifacts|keep track of the provenance of information]]. This connection is essential for [[üé£ Retrieve Information Artifacts|retrieving]] and [[‚ôªÔ∏è Reuse Information Artifacts|reusing]] information across applications.
## Example(s)

One scholar used the [[Zotero Roam]] plug-in to connect [[Roam Research]] with his [[Zotero]] library. This integration allowed him to import [[Metadata]] such as titles, author names, publishers, publication years, cite keys, and DOIs directly into his notes.

Another scholar linked original source materials in [[DevonThink]] to his [[Obsidian]] notebook. For each [[Note Page|literature note]], he included [[Metadata]] containing an [[Internal Hypertext Links|internal link]] to the corresponding PDF in DevonThink. Clicking the link in Obsidian opened the PDF in DevonThink for immediate reference.

## What's needed to enact this pattern

In addition to the tools mentioned above, this pattern can be supported by any tool that includes the following technical primitive(s):

- [[Internal Hypertext Links]]
- [[Metadata]]
- [[Cross-Tool Connections]]
