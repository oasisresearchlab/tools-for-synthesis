Queries are programs embedded in hypertext notebooks that retrieve information artifacts based on user-defined commands. Some are integrated into the toolâ€™s native interface, providing built-in ways to surface relevant notes or data. Others are written and embedded directly by users within note pages (drawing on the tool's specific query language), allowing for custom searches and dynamic displays of content tailored to specific workflows.

Tools that support structured queries are:
- [[Obsidian]]
- [[Logseq]]
- [[Roam Research]] (especially with the [[Roam Discourse Graph plugin]])
- [[Tana]]
- [[Notion]]
