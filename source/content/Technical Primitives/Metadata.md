Metadata provides contextual information about information artifacts in notetaking. It plays an important role in categorizing and organizing artifacts, making it easier to search for specific items. Some markdown-based hypertext notebooks like Zettlr and Obsidian allow users to set metadata for note pages using YAML properties. Some tools support metadata natively; for example, in Tana, users can create metadata for a specific note block through Supertag fields.

Tools that afford Metadata are:
- [[Obsidian]]
- [[Zettlr]]
- [[Bear]]
- [[Tana]] (Fields of [[Supertag]]s)
- [[Logseq]]
- [[Roam Research]] (experimental)
