Graph views are visualized networks that show the connections between different note pages. The note-taking tool identifies these connections through links between note pages and represents them as nodes and edges. Some tools allow users to display 2nd- or nth-order links (e.g., notes indirectly connected to the current note by two or more degrees of separation). Obsidian, Roam Research, and Logseq all natively support displaying connections between note pages using a graph view.
