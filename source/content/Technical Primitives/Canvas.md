A canvas is a feature in some hypertext or note-taking tools that provides an infinite, freeform space for arranging and connecting ideas visually. Users can place or embed notes, images, or other objects on the canvas and position them however they like, creating spatial groupings or layouts that reflect relationships between concepts. Most canvases also allow drawing lines, arrows, or other connectors between items, making it possible to map out relationships or workflows directly.

Crucially, notes placed on a canvas in a hypertext notebook are usually still linked to their original source: clicking or following them will open the full [[Note Page]] they represent. This means the canvas acts as a kind of spatial hypermedia layer—offering visual organization and navigation—while keeping each item connected to the structured, link-rich environment of the underlying notebook.

Hypertext tools that support Canvas are:
- [[Obsidian]] (native)
- [[Logseq]] (native whiteboard)
- [[Roam Research]] (native whiteboard, and plugins like the [[Roam Discourse Graph plugin]])
- [[Kosmik]]
