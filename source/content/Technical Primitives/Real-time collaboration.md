Type: Technical Primitive
---
This technical primitive is typically associated with cloud-based note-taking tools, enabling real-time collaborative synchronization of edits between multiple users in the same notebook. These are sometimes called "multiplayer" tools, to distinguish from "single player" tools like Logseq and Obsidian (though those can enable synchronous collaboration through experimental sync servers via plugins or asynchronous collaboration via [[Versioning]] tools like github)

Tools that directly support real-time collaboration for notetaking are:
- [[Roam Research]]
- [[Notion]]
- [[Tana]]
