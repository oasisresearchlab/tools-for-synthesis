Some tools enable (through core or plugin features) users to map note types/metadata to specific visual displays, such as the color of a note when it is [[Internal Hypertext Links|referenced somewhere]] or present on a [[Canvas]].

Examples include:
- [[Obsidian]] (with the [[Obsidian supercharged links plugin]])
- [[Tana]]
- [[Roam Research]] (with the [[Roam Discourse Graph plugin]])
