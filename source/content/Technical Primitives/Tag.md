A tag is a lightweight, flexible way to categorize and organize information artifacts in a digital notebook or file management system, often applied to [[Metadata]] fields for notes. Unlike folders, which impose a fixed hierarchy, tags allow many-to-many relationshipsâ€”an item can have multiple tags, and the same tag can be applied to items in different contexts. Tags help with filtering, searching, and grouping related materials without duplicating them, making them a versatile tool for organizing notes, documents, and other content. 

Tools that support tags include:
- [[Bear]]
- [[Obsidian]]
- [[Roam Research]]
- [[Tana]] (not to be confused with their Supertag feature, which marks a note as a specific type with an associated metadata schema)
