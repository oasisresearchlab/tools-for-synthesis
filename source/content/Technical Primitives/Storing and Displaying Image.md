Most tools enabled users to upload or copy-paste in images. In local-first tools like Obsidian and logseq, these images are stored locally in a folder; in cloud-based tools like Tana or RoamResearch, these are uploaded to the notes database.

Most of the tools we observed support this primitive:
- [[Roam Research]]
- [[Bear]]
- [[Logseq]]
- [[Notion]]
- [[Obsidian]]
