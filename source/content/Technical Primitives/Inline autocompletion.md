Inline autocompletion is a feature in some hypertext notebooks that suggests completed hypertext links as users begin typing them in a note page or note block. It works by matching the partial input against existing hypertext links in the system, allowing users to quickly insert links to previously created notes. Many users develop naming conventions with consistent prefixes for certain types of notes so they can use inline autocompletion to efficiently search for and insert specific categories of links.

Tools that support inline autocompletion are:
