Type: Technical Primitive

Internal hypertext links connect related note pages or blocks within hypertext notebooks. The most common format is the “wikilink,” a string enclosed in double square brackets (e.g., `[[Linked Note Page Title]]`). Some tools also support “Markdown links,” which use single square brackets for the link text followed by parentheses containing the link’s target (e.g., `[Link Name](AddressOfLinkedFile.md)`). In some tools, links within a note page are referred to as outgoing links. Clicking one of these links opens the targeted note page.

Links are a core technical primitive in all hypertext tools, such as:
- [[Roam Research]]
- [[Obsidian]]
- [[Logseq]]
- [[Notion]]
- [[Bear]]
- [[Tana]]
- [[Emacs with Org-mode]]
- [[Kosmik]]
- [[Zettlr]]
