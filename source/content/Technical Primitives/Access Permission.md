Some users manage collaboration by setting different permission levels for access to their documents. This control helps maintain quality and security in shared work. Often, it involves a mix of tools and file formats to balance openness with protection. For close collaborators, users may grant full editing rights so they can directly contribute to the source material. For others who are less closely involved, access is often restricted to viewing or commenting only. One common approach is sharing a PDF version with distant collaboratorsâ€”allowing feedback through comments while preventing direct edits to the original file. This layered access strategy helps preserve the integrity of source materials while still enabling broader input.

Tools that supports direct control over access:
- [[Google Docs]]
- [[Notion]]
- [[Roam Research]]
- [[Kosmik]]
- [[Tana]]
