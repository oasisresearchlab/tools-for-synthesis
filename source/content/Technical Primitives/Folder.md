A folder is a core feature of all file management systems and the most conventional way of organizing files in both computer systems and physical archives. Folders provide a top-down hierarchy for managing files. However, not all hypertext-based notetaking tools adopt the folder paradigm.

Hypertext tools that support the use of the folders are:
- [[Obsidian]]
- [[Zettlr]] 
- [[Emacs with Org-mode]]
