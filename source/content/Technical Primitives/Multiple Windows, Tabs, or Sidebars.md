Sensemaking is an information-intensive process. Notetaking applications that support complex sensemaking must handle large volumes of information artifacts. Using multiple windows is one way these applications can effectively present information while allowing flexibility for activities like referencing and comparing.

Some applications allow floating windows outside the main application window, enabling users to view and manipulate content in parallel workspaces. Others rely on side panels to provide additional space for extra information artifacts without leaving the main workspace. Both approaches help maintain context and support dynamic, multi-source thinking during sensemaking.


Hypertext tools that allow having multiple windows, tabs, or sidebars are:
