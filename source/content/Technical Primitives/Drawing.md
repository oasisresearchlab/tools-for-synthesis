Drawings in digital notetaking tools are freeform visual annotations used to indicate relationships between notes or other information artifacts on a [[Canvas]]. Unlike the automatically generated links you see in [[Graph view]]s—where connections are derived from explicit hyperlinks—drawings are manually created lines, arrows, or curves that let users depict relationships in a more fluid, spatial, or conceptual way.

Tools that afford drawing are:
- [[Obsidian]] (which has a native [[Canvas]] feature)
- [[Roam Research]] via the tldraw integration in the [[Roam Discourse Graph plugin]])
- [[Logseq]]
- [[Kosmik]]
