Recent rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally change how computers automatically processing textual information. The same applies to hypertext-based notetaking apps. Artificial Intelligence are good at deal with the fragmented nature of sensemaking process. How can we exploit the power of Artificial Intelligence? How can we integrate this power with the power of Hypertext to support sensemaking? These are questions that still need exploration.

As of now, we observed several typical usage of Artificial Intelligence in Hypertext-based Notetaking tools. First, users used AI to help maintain consistency of notetaking, as human cognitive power are weak for these trivial tasks. Second, users used AI to help summarize content for easier reusing over time and sharing between different people.


Some examples of Artificial Intelligence that users used in hypertext-based notetaking tools:
- OpenAI connections to [[Tana]]
- NotionAI for [[Notion]]
- RoamAI for [[Roam Research]]
- [[Logseq]] with plugins like the [logseq-plugin-ai-assistant](https://github.com/ahonn/logseq-plugin-ai-assistant)
- [[Kosmik]]
