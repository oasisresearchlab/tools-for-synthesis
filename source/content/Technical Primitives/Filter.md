A filter is a feature that enables users to narrow the scope of information artifacts. Typically, a filter is a collection of checkbox items that users can use to hide items they do not want to see. Sometimes, filters take other forms, such as slidersâ€”for example, [[Depth of Focus Controls]] use a slider. In other cases, filters can be an input box that allows users to type in queries. In hypertext-based tools, filters are often highly customizable to meet the diverse information needs of different users.
