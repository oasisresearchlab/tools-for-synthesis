Backlinks are typically generated by a toolâ€™s built-in query system, which scans for any other note pages or note blocks that contain an outgoing link to the current note. These results are displayed separately from the main content, giving users an overview of where the current note is referenced elsewhere.

The exact display method varies by platform. For example, Roam Research shows backlinks at the bottom of a note page, grouped into linked and unlinked references. Emacs with Org-Roam opens them in a separate buffer or window, allowing parallel navigation while keeping the main note visible. In Obsidian, backlinks are shown in a dedicated sidebar by default, but can also be embedded directly in a note using a query block.

This placement and visibility of backlinks supports navigation, sensemaking, and context-building by letting users see how their current note is situated in the wider network of their notes without disrupting the primary content space.

Tools that support backlinks are:
- [[Tana]]
- [[Obsidian]]
- [[Logseq]]
- [[Roam Research]]
- [[Zettlr]]
- [[Notion]]
- [[Kosmik]]
