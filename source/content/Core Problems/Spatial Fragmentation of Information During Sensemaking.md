From a spatial perspective, participants described a tension between the required [[🏗️ Consolidate Materials for Active Sensemaking|centralization of information artifacts]] for synthesis and the reality of spatial fragmentation of these information artifacts across a range of “information scraps”[1] that are [[🚛 Transfer Information Artifacts Between Different Locations|instantiated in and transferred across]] tools.

Our participants have developed use patterns with their tools that enable them to [[🎣 Retrieve Information Artifacts|retrieve]], [[🏗️ Consolidate Materials for Active Sensemaking|gather]], and [[♻️ Reuse Information Artifacts|reuse]] previously encountered information that is spatially fragmented.
