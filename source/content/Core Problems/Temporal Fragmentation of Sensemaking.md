From a temporal perspective, sensemaking is inherently episodic, constrained by the limited information and energy available at any given moment. Distracting environments exacerbate this by introducing interruptions that fragment work over extended periods, making it difficult to regain the original train of thought.

As one user explained:

> What I found I need for a big project: I need momentum. But that momentum, you know, through things outside of my control gets derailed pretty quickly. And then by the time I get back to it, I have changed my mind about the whole project and how I want to be approaching it.

To address this challenge, users developed strategies for using their tools to [[🎢 Track Status of Sensemaking]] and [[♻️ Reuse Information Artifacts]] after substantial time had elapsed.
