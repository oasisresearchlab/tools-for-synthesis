Users [[üöõ Transfer Information Artifacts Between Different Locations|move information artifacts between different locations]] to facilitate sensemaking. This often happens when extracting information from an original source through note-taking or excerpting. The original context of information artifacts, such as the location of the original materials and the specific content from which extracted artifacts originate, is often crucial for sensemaking. So, users often need to keep track of the provenance of artifacts to enable them to [[‚ôªÔ∏è Reuse and Retrieve Information Artifacts|return to the original materials]] even after they have been extracted from their original source. 

Users can do this by:
- [[Clearly Marked Excerpts]] to add nuance and background information to information artifacts.
- [[Database Connectors to Reference Managers]] to reduce the friction of accessing source materials.

Two note forms can be used to support this provenance tracking work:
- [[Source Note]] ‚Äî represents source materials within the hypertext note-taking tool.
- [[Summary Note]] ‚Äî interprets original information and includes references to source materials.
