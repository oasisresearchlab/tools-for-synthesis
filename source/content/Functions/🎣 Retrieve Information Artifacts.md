In order to [[üèóÔ∏è Consolidate Materials for Active Sensemaking|gather]] and [[‚ôªÔ∏è Reuse Information Artifacts|reuse]] information for active sensemaking, people need to first retrieve them from the various places in which they are stored.

To accomplish this, people may pre-structure their notes to make them easier to retrieve, such as by:
- [[Note Naming Conventions]]
- [[Structured Metadata for Notes]]

This can help them create [[Filtered Views of Notes|structured filters or queries]] for relevant information.

Naming conventions and metadata can be difficult to consistently follow. People can make this easier with [[AI-powered Labeling]], or [[Note Templates and Rules]]

Users of hypertext notebooks can also use associative navigation strategies, such as:
- [[Link-Based Traversal]] using links and backlinks
- Creating specialized high level constructs to enhance associative retrieval of materials, such as:
	- [[Hub Notes]], which centralize information artifacts by backlinks, serving as waypoints that users can traverse across to get access to other information artifacts.
	- [[Index Notes]], which centralize information artifacts by visualizing them in a list or table.
	- [[Incubator Notes]], which centralize information artifacts, often organized in a chronological order. Different from hubs and indices, incubators are not only a hypertext construct that centralizes information artifacts, but also places where notetaking happen overtime.

Some people also regularly [[Explicit Archiving|archive materials]] to exclude out-of-date and processed information artifacts so information artifacts left active in the system are the most relevant to current sensemaking work.

They may also [[Multiple Access Points|create multiple points of access to the same document or notes]].

Finally, when working together with others in collaborative environments, retrieval can be supported by:
- [[Collaborative Dashboards]] to help collaborators of varying information needs identify what and how to find information artifacts.
- [[Summaries of Notes]] to collaborators who do not have the background knowledge to get up to speed.
