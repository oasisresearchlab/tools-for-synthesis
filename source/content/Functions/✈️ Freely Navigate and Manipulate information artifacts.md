Users often express a desire to explore information artifacts in a freeform manner during sensemaking. However, line-based text-heavy notetaking tools do not support this freeform style well. Such interfaces typically exploit only the vertical dimension of screen space and represent hierarchies solely along that axis, making it difficult to view items from different hierarchical levels simultaneously. 

Spatial interfaces—such as canvases, graph views, and mind maps—can address these limitations. Graph views enable free navigation through artifacts while preserving a holistic view of their connections, though they often do not support direct manipulation of the artifacts. Canvases and mind maps support both navigation and manipulation.

Our observations suggest that users adopt spatial interfaces like canvases to overcome the constraints of linear text-based tools:
- [[Consolidation in Spatial Interfaces]] — presenting all artifacts within a single interface to facilitate recognition of relationships during active sensemaking.
- [[Spatial Clustering and Linking]] — grouping and manipulating artifacts on a canvas to support analysis of their interrelationships.
