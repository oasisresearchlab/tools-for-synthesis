To prepare for sensemaking, users often need to consolidate many information artifacts into a single, centralized, and accessible location so they can all be worked on at once. This need is supported by (but distinct from the need to [[ðŸŽ£ Retrieve Information Artifacts|retrieve information]]).

Users can meet this need for centralization of information with the following use patterns:
- **[[Explicit Archiving]]** â€” removing outdated or processed artifacts so only those relevant to current sensemaking remain active.
- **[[Consolidation in Spatial Interfaces]]** â€” viewing all artifacts at once in a single interface to support relational understanding.
- **[[Filtered Views of Notes]]** â€” excluding irrelevant artifacts to focus on pertinent materials.
- **[[Multiple Side-by-Side Views]]** â€” enabling simultaneous visibility of multiple artifacts.
- **[[Spatial Clustering and Linking]]** â€” grouping and manipulating artifacts on a canvas to analyze relationships.
    
Gathering materials often results in the creation of new artifacts that capture sensemaking outputs:
- **[[Linking in Notes to Synthesize Different Information Artifacts]]** â€” embedding links to integrate multiple artifacts within a single note.
- **[[Synthesis Note]]** â€” representing the integrated results of multiple intellectual components.

Users also create specialized constructs to support gathering, such as:
- **[[Index Notes]]** â€” centralizing artifacts in list or table form.
- **[[Incubator Notes]]** â€” centralizing artifacts in temporal order; unlike hubs or indices, incubators are active spaces for ongoing note-taking over time.
