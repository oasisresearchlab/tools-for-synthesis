In [[ü§ù Collaborate on Sensemaking|collaborative sensemaking settings]], determining what to share and what to keep private is central to managing information artifacts. This involves not only technical considerations but also the social dynamics of the group.

Establishing boundaries for collaboration is often complex. Users must decide which artifacts collaborators can access, what actions collaborators can take on shared artifacts, and who should have different levels of access. These boundaries operate both between public and personal artifacts and across different roles within a collaborative project.

Observed strategies for setting such boundaries include:
- **[[Personal Spaces in Shared Notebooks]]** ‚Äî maintaining dedicated spaces for personal artifacts.
- **[[Separate Shareable Versions for Collaborators]]** ‚Äî segmenting access to artifacts based on collaborator roles.
