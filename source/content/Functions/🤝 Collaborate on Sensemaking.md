Individual sensemaking efforts can often contribute to collective sensemaking. To support collaboration on sensemaking, users need to develop ways to [[🎣 Retrieve Information Artifacts|retrieve]] and [[♻️ Reuse Information Artifacts|reuse]] information artifacts generated by their collaborators, [[🧱 Establish Boundaries for Collaboration|establish boundaries between collaborators]], and  [[✉️ Communicate with Collaborators|communicate with collaborators]].

To make artifacts easier to share and reuse, users developed the following use patterns:
- **[[Summaries of Notes]]** — reducing complexity to improve reusability of information-intensive artifacts.
- **[[Note Templates and Rules|Using Templates and Rules]]** — enforcing consistent formats to support interoperability.
- **[[Collaborative Dashboards|Guiding Information Foraging]]** — helping collaborators with diverse needs identify effective retrieval strategies quickly.
    
To establish safe controls over collaboration, users developed the following use patterns:
- **[[Separate Shareable Versions for Collaborators]]** — segmenting access based on collaborator roles.
- **[[Personal Spaces in Shared Notebooks]]** — maintaining distinct spaces for personal and shared artifacts.
- **[[Version Controlling Notes]]** — safeguarding both personal and shared artifacts from unwanted changes.

To support communication, users developed the following use pattern:
- **[[In-Notebook Messaging]]** — enabling direct, embedded communication within the shared workspace.
