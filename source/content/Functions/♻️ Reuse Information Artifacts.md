During sensemaking, people need to reuse previously stored or encountered information. For example, they might adapt a previous idea into a new argument, or draw on notes on findings from research papers to develop a hypothesis.

To do this, people need to [[ðŸŽ£ Retrieve Information Artifacts|retrieve]] information artifacts that contain or describe this information. But they also need to [[ðŸŒ± Track Provenance of Information Artifacts|trace the provenance of those information artifacts]] to fully understand and adapt previously encountered information. 

We've also observed people "pre-processing" their notes to make them more suitable for future reuse. For example, people may [[Declarative Atomic Notes|create notes with declarative atomic statements as titles]] that can be more readily reused in arguments.
