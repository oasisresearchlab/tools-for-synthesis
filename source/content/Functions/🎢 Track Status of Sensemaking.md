Complex sensemaking naturally fragments over [[Spatial Fragmentation of Information During Sensemaking|space]] and [[Temporal Fragmentation of Sensemaking|time]], making it difficult to [[‚ôªÔ∏è Reuse and Retrieve Information Artifacts|retrieve information artifacts]] and determine the stage of sensemaking to which they belong. 

Addressing these challenges requires mechanisms for tracking the status of sensemaking. Users need to assess the maturity of their artifacts: for example, whether a note fully articulates their own ideas and is ready for inclusion in a manuscript, or whether a source has been thoroughly read and its key insights extracted for a project.

We observed that hypertext-based note-taking tools enable specific use patterns that support status tracking:
- **[[Placeholder Notes]]** ‚Äî used as placeholders or pointers for further development; emptiness signals the need for work.
- **[[Explicit Note Types for Sensemaking Stages]]** ‚Äî separating artifacts by maturity level.
- **[[Reading Status Markers]]** ‚Äî managing reading progress.
- **[[Note Naming Conventions]]** ‚Äî maintaining consistent naming for long-term retrieval and comprehension.
- **[[Incubator Notes]]** ‚Äî centralizing artifacts by temporal order; unlike hubs or indices, incubators are active spaces for ongoing note-taking.
- **[[Daily Chronological Notes]]** ‚Äî marking the timing of sensemaking activities.
- **[[Summary Note]]** ‚Äî interpreting original information and referencing source materials.
- **[[Synthesis Note]]** ‚Äî capturing the integrated results of multiple intellectual components.
