Currently, no all-in-one tool exists for sensemaking. Users of hypertext-based note-taking systems routinely rely on multiple tools to support their work. Yet sensemaking benefits from a focused environment where users can categorize and compare artifacts effectively.

For complex or long-term tasks, [[🏗️ Consolidate Materials for Active Sensemaking|centralizing artifacts in a single location]]—ideally within a single tool—is especially valuable. Hypertext-based systems offer the flexibility to accommodate diverse artifact types and create connections between them, motivating users to transfer materials from other tools into their hypertext environment.

Observed patterns when transferring artifacts across locations include:
- **[[Database Connectors to Reference Managers]]** — reducing friction in accessing source materials.
- **[[Source Note]]** — representing source materials within the hypertext system for easier retrieval.
- **[[Commonplace Inboxes]]** — simplifying organization at the point of capture.
