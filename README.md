## About

This repository hosts the files for an in-progress hypertext notebook that describes some key findings from our [Sloan-funded research project](https://oasisresearchlab.github.io/synthesis-infrastructure-foundation/index.html) investigating novel tools and organizational structures that can support new infrastructures for research synthesis. The research here is led by [Joel Chan](http://joelchan.me/) and [Siyi Zhu](https://www.siyizhu.net/) out of the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://hcil.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, and builds on and extends earlier work done in collaboration with [Robert Haisfield](https://robhaisfield.com/about) and [Brendan Langen](https://www.brendanlangen.com/) on [Scaling Synthesis](https://scalingsynthesis.com/). This notebook focuses on our findings about how researchers use novel **tools** (such as [hypertext notebooks](https://scalingsynthesis.com/q-what-is-a-hypertext-notebook/)) to support the sensemaking work that is needed for research synthesis.

## Contributing

Issues or pull requests are welcome. Here are some ideas for what we expect might need improvement over time:
- The list of tools is representative but not exhaustive, so you’re welcome to suggest new tools to add, especially if they relate to any of the technical primitives and/or use patterns.
- Many of the tools also evolve (sometimes with extensive plugin ecosystems), so various technical primitives or use patterns might be possible to enact in tools that we’ve missed.
- We’d also be really keen to hear of any other patterns you’ve observed or come up with.
